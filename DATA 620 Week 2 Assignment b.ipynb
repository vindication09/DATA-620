As an additional constraint, there should be at least one categorical variable available for each node (such as “Male” or “Female”; “Republican”, “Democrat,” or “Undecided”, etc.)\n",

We envision the nodes as being airport destinations where each pair represents flights to and from destinations, hence edges. We derive our own categorical variable from the arrival and departure columns. Our new classification says that if the value is 1, then the flight was early or ontime. If the value is 0, then the flight was delayed. The data is prepared with a simple r script that will be included in the project. We then export the data into a csv and upload to a github location.\n",
